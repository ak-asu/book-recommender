When generating code (follow these points and their priority is in the give order):
- Use best practices and industry standards
- Give efficient, optimized and highly performant code whenever possible
- Write modular and reusable code
- Use design patterns when appropriate
- Consider using appropriate highly rated and popular npm or python or pub.dev packages when applicable
- Follow the project's existing coding style and theme and project-specific naming conventions for files and folders
- Implement proper security measures
- Implement error handling and input validation when applicable

**Project Overview:**  
Build a fully functional, deployable, and scalable book recommendation web application. The application should cater to both guest and registered users, providing personalized book recommendations using a hybrid recommendation engine that integrates OpenAI’s API for natural language processing along with traditional collaborative and content-based filtering techniques. Data storage, user authentication, and persistence will be managed using Firebase (Firestore and Firebase Auth). The UI must be modern, responsive, and accessible, built with NextJS, NextUI (or HeroUI), React, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. **Landing Page:**  
   - A central ChatGPT-style search bar with a dropdown at the bottom left offering additional search options (e.g., genre, length, mood).
   - Two arrow buttons on the left for navigating back and forth through the current session’s search results/history.
   - Top-right controls for deleting, exporting, and sharing the chat/conversation history.
   - When no text is entered, display a grid/array of popular book recommendations (best-sellers or trending books).
   - Each displayed recommendation features interactive controls: a “regenerate” button and like/dislike feedback similar to ChatGPT’s feedback mechanism.
   - The search query (with dropdown-selected options) is sent to the backend, which calls OpenAI’s API to generate a list of book recommendations. Results are stored in Firebase and displayed as a list of rectangular book cards.

2. **Search Results & Book Cards:**  
   - Each book card must include:
     - A left-aligned book image.
     - Right-side vertical layout displaying the title, author, publication date, rating, reviews, and a short description.
     - Top-right icons/buttons for bookmarking and sharing.
   - Clicking a book card navigates to the detailed Book Detail Page.

3. **Book Detail Page:**  
   - Display comprehensive details:
     - Book cover, title, author, detailed synopsis, genre, rating, reviews count, ranking, page count, volume/series information, and any other metadata.
     - Display similar books based on recommendation logic.
     - Include actionable links (with logos/icons) for “Where to Read” or “Where to Buy” (integrating external sites like Amazon or local libraries).
     - Options for users to bookmark, share, and leave reviews.

4. **User Management & Personalization:**  
   - **Login/Logout Page:** Implement user authentication via Firebase Auth (email/password, social providers if possible).
   - **Account Page:** Allow registered users to view and edit their profiles, saved preferences, and manage bookmarks.
   - **Favorites/Bookmarks Page:** A tabbed interface showing favorites, bookmarked items, and items “saved for later.”
   - The system must record user interactions and feedback (like/dislike, regenerate) to build and update user preference probabilities (e.g., probability of liking horror, shorter books) for personalized recommendations.
   - **Guest Users:** Allow full browsing and session-based history navigation without saving preferences or data persistently.

5. **Recommendation Engine:**  
   - Use a hybrid model:
     - Integrate OpenAI’s API to process natural language prompts and generate dynamic recommendations.
     - Combine with collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to refine recommendations.
   - Display popular recommendations on initial load when the search bar is empty.
   - Continuously update user preference profiles in Firebase based on interaction feedback.

6. **Backend & API Integration:**  
   - Develop RESTful API endpoints using NextJS API routes that:
     - Handle search queries, call OpenAI’s API, and save results to Firebase.
     - Manage user data (authentication, history, bookmarks, preferences).
     - Serve dynamic book data (from your internal database and external integrations).
   - Implement robust error handling, API versioning, and comprehensive documentation (using Swagger/Postman-style documentation).
   - When a search is performed, the query is processed by the backend which calls the OpenAI API for natural language processing and then stores the results in the database for future reference and improved recommendation accuracy.  
   - User feedback (like/dislike, regenerate) is recorded to refine recommendation algorithms and update user preference probabilities for registered users.

7. **UI/UX & Components:**  
   - Use HeroUI with NextJS and React to build a responsive, modern interface.
   - Create modular, reusable components for:
     - Search bar with dropdown.
     - Navigation arrows and control buttons (delete, export, share).
     - Book card components.
     - Detailed book view components.
     - Feedback widgets (like/dislike, regenerate).
     - Modals/dialogs for filters, export options, and sharing.
   - Implement smooth transitions and animations for navigation and interactive elements.
   - Ensure a mobile-first design with responsiveness across all devices and browsers.
   - Adhere to accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 compliance, semantic markup, ARIA roles).

8. **State Management & Performance:**  
   - Use React Context API or a state management library (e.g., Redux) to manage global application state.
   - Optimize performance with code splitting (using NextJS dynamic imports), lazy loading, and efficient caching of API responses.
   - Manage local vs. global state to ensure smooth user interactions and consistent UI updates.
